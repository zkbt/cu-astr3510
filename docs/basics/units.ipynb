    "# üìèüèãÔ∏è‚òïÔ∏è Using Units\n",
    "This page shows how to use `astropy.units` and `astropy.constants` to attach physical units to numbers and arrays. When doing calculations, numbers are just numbers, and Python will happily calculate whatever we tell it to, whether that calculation makes conceptual sense or not. To help remedy this problem, the community-developed `astropy` package provides a snazzy toolkit for attaching units to quantities, handling conversions between units, and making our code complain if we try to do something nonesensical.
