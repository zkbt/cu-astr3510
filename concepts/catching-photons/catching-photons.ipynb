    "\n",
    "Light travels as photons. When we talk about the luminosity of a star or the brightness of the Sun in the sky, we're talking about so many photons that it makes sense to treat light as a continuous stream. However, when light spreads out of interstellar distances or when we're imaging something that's intrinsically faint, we need to start paying attention to individual photons. When we're measuring light, even if we neglect all other sources of noise, the randomness of the times with which these photons arrive at our telescope create an inescapable source of uncertainty called \"photon noise\" or \"Poisson noise.\"\n",

We can imagine our telescope as a light bucket, that we hold out in this rain of photons. The larger our bucket (telescope aperture) or the longer we let it collect rain (exposure time), the more raindrops will fall into the bucket (photons). \n",

The discrete nature of light means that the actual photons we detect in a given observation will be drawn from a Poisson probability distribution centered at the expected number of photons. \n",
